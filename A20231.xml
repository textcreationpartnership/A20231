            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>Anſweres to the particulars proponed by <hi>His Majeſties Commiſſionar.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>HAving ſeriouſly conſidered with our ſelves that nothing in this world is ſo pretious, and ought to be ſo deare unto us as our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion that the diſeaſes of this Kirk after long toleration did threaten no leſſe then her owne ruine, and expiring of the trueth of Religion at laſt. And that a free generall Aſſembly was the ordinarie remedie ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by divine authoritie; and bleſſed by divine providence in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Kirks, and after a ſpeciall manner in the Kirk of <hi>Scotland;</hi> Wee have often and earneſtly ſupplicated for the ſame; and have laboured to remove what was objected, or what we could conceive to bee any hinderance to the obtaining of our deſire, like as wee have now for the ſame good end reſolved to returne this Anſwer to the particulars proponed to be performed by us before an Aſſembly be indicted.</p>
            <p>The particulars proponed are either matters Eccleſiaſtick or civill: Eccleſiaſtick or kirk matters are, the firſt concerning Miniſters de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed or ſuſpended by the preſbyteries, ſince the firſt of Februar laſt without warrant of the Ordinar, that they be reponed to their own places. The ſecond, concerning Moderators of preſbytrys depoſed ſince the forſaid day to be reponed, and all Moderators appointed by the ſaid preſbyteries without warrant forſaid to deſiſt from executing the office of Moderator. The third, anent Miniſters admitted ſince the day forſaid, that they deſiſt from exerciſing the function of the Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie in that place to which they had beene admitted, Theſe three par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars doe concerne the power, duetie and particular facts or faults of preſbyteries, wherein wee have no power to judge and determine whether they have lawfully proceeded or not, far leſſe can we urge or command them to altar or recall what they have determined or done, in the ſuſpending, depoſing or admitting of Miniſters or Moderators: they being properly ſubject to the ſuperiour Aſſemblies of the Kirk, and in this caſe and condition of the Kirk, to the generall Aſſembly, where if they ſhall not after tryall juſtifie their proceedings from the good warrants of Scripture, reaſon, and of the acts and practiſes of the Kirk, they ought ſuſtaine their own deſerved cenſure. And ſince upon the one ſide there be many complaints, againſt the prelats for their uſurpation over Preſbyteries in the like particulars: And on the other ſide there bee ſuch complaints of the doings and diſorders of preſbyteries to the offence of the Prelats, We truſt that his Majeſties
<pb facs="tcp:23751:2"/>Commiſſionar will not eſteeme this to bee an hinderance of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of a generall Aſſembly: but rather a powerfull and principall motive with ſpeed to conveene the ſame, as the proper judicatorie for determining ſuch dangerous and univerſall differences of the Kirke. Neither doe wee heare that any Minſters are depoſed: but ſome on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuſpended during this <hi>interim,</hi> till a generall Aſſembly for their erroneous doctrine and flagitious life: So that it were moſt offenſive to God, diſgracefull to Religion, and ſcandalous to the people to repone them to their places, till they be tryed and cenſured. And concerning Moderators none of them (as we underſtand) are depoſed, but ſome only changed, which is very ordinary in this Kirk.</p>
            <p>The fourth, anent the reparing of Parochiners to their own Kirks, and that Elders aſſiſt their Miniſter in the diſcipline of the Kirk ought to bee cognoſced and judged by the particular Preſbyterie, to which the Parochiners and elders are ſubject, ſince the cauſe may bee in the Miniſters no leſſe then the parochiners add elders And incaſe they ſinde no redreſſe there, to aſcend till they come to a generall Aſſembly, the want whereof makes diſorders to be multiplyed both in preſby<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and paroches.</p>
            <p>To the ſixth, that Miniſters waite upon their owne Kirks; and that none of them come to the aſſembly or place where the ſame is keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: but ſuch as ſhall be choſen Commiſſionars from pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſbyteries.</p>
            <p>Wee anſwere, that none are to come to the place of the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, but ſuch as are either allowed by commiſſion, or other-wiſe have ſuch <hi>intereſt</hi> as they can approve to his Majeſties Commiſſionar, and the Aſſembly conveened.</p>
            <p>To the ſeventh, anent the appointing of Moderators of preſbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to be Commiſſionars to the generall aſſembly: only conſtant Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deratours who ceaſed long ſince, were found in the aſſembly 1606. (which yet was never reputed by this Kirk to be a lawfull nationall aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly) to be neceſſarie members of a generall aſſembly. And if both the Moderators. Who if they be neceſſarie members need not to bee choſen, and the choſen Commiſſionars repare to the aſſembly: the Aſſembly it ſelf can judge beſt of the members where-of it ought to bee conſtitute.</p>
            <p>To the nynth, that no laick whatſoever meddle with the chooſing of Commiſſionars for the preſbyteries, and no Miniſter without his owne preſbyterie: Wee ſay that according to the order of the Kirk
<pb facs="tcp:23751:2"/>none but Miniſters and Elders of Kirks ought to have voice in choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Commiſſionars for preſbyteries: And that no Miniſter or Elder ought to have voice in election, but in his own preſbyterie.</p>
            <p>The reſt of the particulars are civill matters, as the fifth, anent the paying of the rents and ſtipends of Biſhops and Miniſters: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which wee can ſay no further but that the Lawes are patent for them as others his Majeſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es ſubjects. And that the generall aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ought not to be delayed upon any complaint of that kinde.</p>
            <p>The eight, requiring that Biſhops and other Miniſters may bee ſecured in their perſons: We thinke ſo reaſonable, that wee will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe everie one of us for our own parts they ſhall ſuffer no violence from us, and ſhall hinder others ſo far as we may, and if any trouble them otherwiſe, or make them any kinde of moleſtation in that atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, except by order of Law<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s the parties are juſtly puniſhable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the degrie of their faule as other ſubjects are.</p>
            <p>To the tenth, concerning the diſſolving of all convocations &amp; meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and the peaceableneſſe of the Countrie. Theſe meetings being keeped for no other end, but for conſul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing about lawfull remedies againſt ſuch preſſing grievances as threaten the deſolation of the Kirk and State, cannot be diſſolved till the evils be removed. And we truſt that nothing in theſe our meetings hath eſcaped us which earrſeth in it the ſmalleſt appearance of unduetifulneſſe, or which may ſeeme to tend to the breach of the common peace; But although our adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries have heerein calumniated us, yet we have alwayes ſo behaved our ſelves as beſeemed his Majeſties moſt humble and loyall ſubjects, petitioning his Majeſtie for a legall redreſſe of our juſt grievances.</p>
            <p>To the laſt, concerning the Covenant: the Commiſſioner his G. having many times and moſt inſtantly preſſed us with that point. We did firſt by invincible reaſons make manifeſt that we could not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſinning againſt God and our conſciences; and without wrong done to this nationall Kirk, and the poſteritie, reſcinde or alter the ſame. And thereafter did at length cleare the ſame of all unlawfull combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation againſt authority by our laſt Supplication &amp; declaration, which his Majeſties Commiſſionar accepted as the moſt readie and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of all other meanes which could come within the compaſſe of our thoughts to give his Majeſtie ſatisfaction. The Subſcription of this our Confeſſion of Faith and Covenant, being an act ſo evidently tending to the glorie of God, the Kings honour, and happineſſe of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
<pb facs="tcp:23751:3"/>And having alreadie proven ſo comfortable to us in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of our hearts: It is our ardent and conſtant deſire, and heartie with that both his Majeſtie, and all his good Subjects may bee par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the ſame comfort: Like as we finde our ſelves bound by conſcience and by the Covenant it ſelfe to perſwade all his Majeſties good Subjects to joyne with us for the good of Religion, his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties honour, and the quyetneſſe of the Kingdome, which being mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly uſed by us without preſſing or threatning of the meaneſt, wee hope ſhall never give his Majeſtie the leaſt cauſe of diſcontent.</p>
            <p>Seeing therefore according to our power and intereſt wee are moſt willing to remove all hinderances, that things may bee carried in a peaceable manner worthie of our profeſſion and Covenant, doe ayme at nothing but the good of the Kingdome, and preſervation of the Kirk, which by conſumption and combuſtion is like to bee deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately diſeaſed, except remedie ſome way be ſpeedily provided; and delight to uſe no other meanes but ſuch as are legall, and have beene ordinarie in this Kirk ſince the reformation, We are confident that without further delay for preventing of greater evills and miſeries than wee can expreſſe, Our juſt deſires ſhall bee granted; So ſhall we bee incouraged in the peace of our ſoules ſtill to pray for his Majeſtie all encreaſe of true honour and happineſſe.</p>
